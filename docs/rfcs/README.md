# Request for Comments (RFCs)

RFCs are short proposals for how we plan to build something. They’re meant to spark discussion and line up the team on the “how” before we invest in implementation.

## Lifecycle

Use a status that reflects where the proposal is right now:

1. **Draft** — Initial write-up, looking for first reactions, Team is reviewing and giving feedback
2. **Proposed** — Team is reviewing and giving feedback
3. **Approved** — Good to go; ready to implement
4. **Implemented** — Shipped and verified


## Creating an RFC

Write what’s helpful, not everything. A good starting outline:

- **Proposal Overview** — What we’re doing and why (2–3 sentences)
- **Background** — Current state; link to ADRs for the decision context
- **Proposal Details** — Architecture changes, tradeoffs, diagrams
- **Implementation Plan** — Phases, checklist, risks
- **Open Questions** — What needs team input to move forward
- **References** — Links to ADRs, docs, PRs

## ADRs vs RFCs

- **ADRs**  = the decision (what + why)
- **RFCs**  = the plan (how)

Link them when they’re related so readers can move between the “why” and the “how”.

## Review Process

1. Create the RFC as **Draft**
2. Share with the team (PR, Slack, short review session) or not :)
   1. Collect feedback and adjust
3. Mark **Approved** when it’s clear enough to implement
4. Implement, then mark **Implemented**

No heavy process. The goal is shared understanding and a written record we can reference later.
